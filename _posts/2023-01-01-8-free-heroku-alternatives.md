Heroku is best SaaS cloud platforms with a free hosting service. Heroku runs on fast Linux sub-containers called "dynos".

The Free plan gave generous 550-1,000 dyno hours per month. Which contained 512Mb ram, 2 simultaneous processes, deployment with git and docker, custom domains, automatic OS patching, etc.

But, as you know every free thing does not last forever. So some days ago [Heroku announced](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) that they would shut down the free service on November 28th, 2022. That's why we make a sophisticated list of free Heroku alternatives. Which gave every user what they need at absolutely free of cost.

## **Vercel**

Vercel is the best free cloud platform for frontend frameworks and static sites or apps. Vercel gave the seamless Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket integration for fast deployment. Vercel uses the fastest global edge network with 99.99% uptime for better reliability. It also offers a free SSL certificate, asset compression, and cache invalidation. Vercel is the best for Next.js developers.

In free Vercel [cloud hosting](https://tecroxy.com/cloudways-review) plan which they called the Hobby plan offers free 100GB bandwidth/month, 100GB-Hours serverless function execution, 6000 minutes of build time, 1000 source image optimization, 50 domains per project, free analytics, and many more which you see on their website.

They also offer Pro which cost $20 per user/month and a Custom Enterprise plan.

In the Vercel Hobby plan, the only major drawback that I phase is for Personal use not for Commercial use purpose. For a personal blog or testing, it's so good but for commercial purposes, I recommended its pro plan.
